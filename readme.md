# zoup

![zoup](assets/zoup.s.png)

zoup is reminiscent of by what [soup.io](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soup.io) [was](https://archive.is/MUIrG), somewhere between a feed aggregator and a tumblelog. 
instead of a centralised site, zoup will be distributed; every user can host their own federated instance.

zoup is not one software but a minimalistic spec, based on existing open standards.
the zoup spec and reference implementation will be in the public domain.

## the spec

see [spec.md](spec).

## reference implementaion

there will be at least one reference implementation of the zoup spec in the public domain.
it should be as self contained as possible, run with minimal dependencies and requirements,
and be deployable on any posix-ish server.

## contribute

zoup is open to contributions. feel free to [open issues](https://github.com/zoupio/spec/issues) to discuss and [send pull requests](https://github.com/zoupio/spec/pulls) to improve the spec.
